# Cred_music_app<br>
<br>A music app by cred - allows to play music just like spotify
<br>Respected Judging members at CRED-
<br>The App is nearly completed but due to time constraints, I am not able to implement some features in the app.
<br>Source code is uploaded on github for your reference - https://github.com/namankhurpia/Cred_music_app
<br>For designing i used Adobe XD - the scrennshots and XD file is included in the zip


<br><br>
<br>The app has the following functionalities - 

<br>1 - fetch music, album logo, url from the given Api
<br>2 - asthetic ui design to please the eyes
<br>3 - Progress bars at correct points
<br>4 - download button to show subscription page
<br>5 - payment implemented using razor-pay - SDK
<br>6 - tested payment implementation.
<br>7 - swipe gestures to change music track
<br>8 - next and previous button to change music
<br>9 - loading gif animation
<br>
<br>Unable to implement due to time constaints-
<br>
<br>1 - swipe animation while changing the music
<br>2 - faster loading in background (using a service, playback options)

<br><br>
<br>Overall the app has custom fonts, best ui,

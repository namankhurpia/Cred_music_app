# Cred_music_app
A music app by cred - allows to play music just like spotify
Respected Judging members at CRED-
The App is nearly completed but due to time constraints, I am not able to implement some features in the app.
Source code is uploaded on github for your reference - https://github.com/namankhurpia/Cred_music_app
For designing i used Adobe XD - the scrennshots and XD file is included in the zip



The app has the following functionalities - 

1 - fetch music, album logo, url from the given Api
2 - asthetic ui design to please the eyes
3 - Progress bars at correct points
4 - download button to show subscription page
5 - payment implemented using razor-pay - SDK
6 - tested payment implementation.
7 - swipe gestures to change music track
8 - next and previous button to change music
9 - loading gif animation

Unable to implement due to time constaints-

1 - swipe animation while changing the music
2 - faster loading in background (using a service, playback options)


Overall the app has custom fonts, best ui,
